0fed60b513d1dd8f, page is in rough shape with the recent purge of content  the page is not as informative as it once was the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed one editor may appear to  hate  naturalfinance net  since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links  but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work  and the link to reciprocity is not online  and the topic not a major issue both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available in order to be bold  i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content  including from sources that are not government funded basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda  and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article  and prejudices suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening barring this broadened content eligibility  we all need guidance for what is eligible content  and perhaps what makes naturalfinance net ineligible  the content there was written in and has been adopted  whether independently or without attribution  by other authors here is the major recent deletion https en wikipedia org w index php title basic income diff oldid specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced some of these can be sourced elsewhere  but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits  naturalfinance net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don t spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients  or find and punish abusers basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions  such as social security in the us  is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened  reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation  and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction viewed this way  the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen  even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically  with less requirement on charity and welfare it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner natural finance s definition of social dividends  variable basic income  tax revenue surplus over social program expenses  essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic  productivity  and automation growth  the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

08ff307d7d98ce9b,possible images so i just removed a huge mate  ad from the article  because in my opinion  although i believe it was added in good faith by user krw it s inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class  some examples i looked at included soft drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf  with a photo of the diet pepsi product line much lower down potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging  and the third is a non current ad  fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped  and only the big mac is clearly identifiable plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants  chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown this brings up a quandry  what do we use for images  my best ideas are to make mockups of a hypothetical dating site front page or ad and use them instead of real images  suggestions ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
